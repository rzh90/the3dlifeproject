										<h2>About me</h2>
										<p>My name is Ilona, and I'm a Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist (CSCS) through the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA).</p>
										<p>I love everything about coaching. Watching my clients gain confidence and incorporate their own version of fitness and nutrition into their lives is incredibly rewarding, as is helping people learn about their bodies and gain knowledge which allows them to filter out the misleading and downright false information so commonly spread by the fitness industry.</p>
										<p>In 2008, I had dreams of being a professional athlete, and was willing to do anything to improve and win. The sport's culture revolved around pushing yourself harder, outworking your opponent, ignoring pain and injuries, taking as little time away from training as possible, and dramatically reducing food intake before competition to be lean.</p>
										<p>The downside of this approach was that it left me injured and with eating behaviours that bordered on disorder; the upside was that it drove me to seek out evidence based resources in an attempt to undo the damage. The subsequent dramatic difference in how I felt and what I was able to do left me with a new goal of helping others reach their goals in safe and healthy ways. After my experience, I firmly believe that training and nutrition habits need to be evidence-based, compatible with your lifestyle, and not overly restrictive or stressful.</p>

										<h2>My coaching</h2>
										<p>I chose the name 3D Life because biological, psychological, and social factors all intertwine to create a given outcome. Sustainable results happen when all of these areas are taken into consideration, which requires substantial communication between client and coach.</p>
										<p>My role is to:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Create training programs that are tailored to your goals</li>
											<li>Coach exercise technique in a way that best suits your body</li>
											<li>Provide information about training and nutrition science to help you understand why you are eating or training in a given way</li>
											<li>Help you navigate obstacles you encounter</li>
											<li>Support you in creating a lifestyle that allows you to reach your goals without negatively impacting your psychological well-being</li>

									<h2>References</h2>
									<p>I was lucky enough to find Ilona (though in some cases I think I was lucky enough that she found me) in March 2020. At that point I had been in crash diet mode for about 18 months and starting to feel some negative effects from that coupled with a lot of forced exercise. My behaviour towards eating and exercising was bordering on disordered and though I knew something was wrong and needed to change, I wasn't sure how to go about it, and it was frightening.</p>
									
									<p>Ilona helped me transition away from a woman eating very little and exercising 6-7 days a week (fueled by an obsession with her scale weight and unrealistic body measurements), to a woman who eats with the focus of not "how much should I eat", but "how much CAN I eat" - and hitting a conventional deadlift PR of over twice my bodyweight. She was there, and always continues to be there whenever I feel like I can't trust myself that what I'm doing is right for me.</p>

									<p>In my instance, I had climbed up the wrong mountain, and while I could have slowly made my way down (not without more injury), she was there at the base of the mountain telling me to jump so that we could, together, climb the right one.</p>

								<p>I met Ilona when I took my 16 year old daughter, Briley, to see her for a dance injury. We had tried everything else and it appeared that quitting her full time dance program was the only option. As a typical mom, I was so focused on my daughter’s injury that I ignored my own health.</p>

								<p>For years I had suffered neck and back pain, for which I saw a chiropractor regularly, but I also struggled with tennis elbow in both elbows and IT Band Syndrome, all of which were making regular exercise an impossibility. To top it off, I was just 2 years post chemotherapy and numerous surgeries including a double mastectomy with reconstruction after breast cancer. I was a mess and it all came to light one afternoon when on a walk I needed to cross a tiny stream and cried because I didn’t have the courage or strength to do it. When we met Ilona the first time, I was so impressed with her hour-long evaluation of my daughter I asked if she would see me too.</p>

								<p>My daughter and I have been seeing Ilona twice a week for just over 2 years, give or take the odd day off when schedules didn’t jive. Not only can I stand, squat, deadlift and lunge on a leg that was too weak to stand on when we began, but I no longer have any sign of IT Band issues. When I first attempted pullups I could barely reach my arms above my head to touch the bar. I can now easily do band-assisted pullups and have recently moved to a smaller band. Five weeks ago, I had my long-awaited final reconstruction surgery and within two weeks had full range of motion and had resumed pullups!</p>

								<p>I own a cosmetic and medical tattoo business and it is common in my line of work for neck and back issues. I am on message boards with 20-somethings who are ending their careers because of pain. I am 51 years old and work all day, every day, with no pain at all. I haven’t seen my chiropractor once since beginning strength training with Ilona and have more confidence in my body than I have ever had in my life.</p>

								<p>My daughter continued on with dance for two years before finally quitting entirely. She is still committed to strength training and is looking forward to college and a career in health and rehabilitation.</p>
